## Overview

Now that we have done all this work to set-up, clibrate, and validate SWAT, we can explore our results. However, before we jump into data analysis, there are a few things we need to do. First, we need to make sure  we understand the purpose of each of the 10 SWAT output files. Next, we might want to reformat these raw SWAT output files so they are easier to work with (i.e., tidy them up). Last, we have to save these reformatted outputs so we can use them for data analysis. This act of taking raw SWAT outputs, reformatting them, and saving this reformatted version is called *post-processing*.

The overall goal of this workshop session is to provide you with some tools to make your post-processing of SWAT outputs easy and reproducible.

By the end of this workshop session you will be able to:

1. *explain* different SWAT output files and their contents

2. *describe* key tidy data principles


## SWAT Output Files

Activity 1:

1. Navigate to the `TxtInOut` directory on your computer (C drive > SWAT > SWATRuns > XXXX > Scenarios > Default > TxtInOut) and, using the search bar, type in 'output'. Pull out a piece of paper and jot down the names of the 10 different plain text files you see (hint: they should differ only by their file extensions).

2. *(5 min on your own)* Now that you have a list of the 10 files, head over to chapter 32 of the SWAT help manual here: http://swat.tamu.edu/media/69395/ch32_output.pdf. Read through the SWAT documentaiton and jot down a short summary of the informaiton contained in each file you listed in #1.

3. *(5 min with a partner)* Share what you found with a partner.

4. *(5 min class discussion)* Share what you and your partner found with the class.


## What is tidy data?

According to the [RStudio Data Wrangling Cheatsheet...](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

![](images/tidy_data.jpg)

Open up the `output.rch` file in your favorite text editor. How is it organized? Is it tidy? Why or why not?





```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## 



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
