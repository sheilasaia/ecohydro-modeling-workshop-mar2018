```

## 1. Overview

In post-processing part 1, we were introduced to the different SWAT output files, learned about tidy data concepts, and started importing SWAT outputs into R/RStudio. Here we will learn how to plot these data in ways that are helpful to our research.

By the end of this workshop session you will be able to:

1. *describe* common figures for exploring and publishing SWAT results

2. *modify* R code to import and plot SWAT data


## 2. Importing Data

First set your working directory as we did in post-processing part 1.

```{r set path, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

setwd('/Users/ssaia/Documents/GitHub/ecohydro-modeling-workshop-mar2018/data/swat_output_data')
# copy/paste the path to the data directory inside the function setwd()
# windows users may have to change /'s to \\'s when copy/pasting

```

Next let's load our package.

```{r loading packages, results=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse) # do this each time you open a new script and need it

```

Now let's import the raw `output.rch` file.

```{r import raw data, results = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# You will need to change what's between the 's here. It should be output.rch.
raw_rch_data = read_table2('/Users/ssaia/Documents/GitHub/ecohydro-modeling-workshop-mar2018/data/swat_output_data/output.rch', col_names=FALSE, skip=9)

```

Let's look at the data? What's different about it from the first time we tried importing it? Hint: Look closely at the modifications made to the `read_table()` function. You can read more about `read_table2()` by searching for the function in your plot/help window.

But there are still some problems. For example, there is no simulation year column.

``` {r show raw data}

head(raw_rch_data, n = 10)

```

Ok, let's reformat these raw data a little more using the `reformat_monthly_rch_file()` function.

```{r reformat raw data, results = FALSE,}

source('reformat_monthly_rch_file.R') # add the reformat_rch_file() function to our working environment

rch_data = reformat_monthly_rch_file(raw_rch_data)

```

Let's look at the result now. This should be more useable/tidy! :)

``` {r look at reformatted data}

head(rch_data, n = 18)

```


## Brainstorming Plots

Activity 1:

1. *(5 min on your own)* Think of some SWAT (or other model) papers you'v read. What types of figure do you always see with regards to streamflow? Hint: If you were a hydrologist, what would you absolutely want to see? How might this change depending on the time step (i.e., daily, monthly, yearly) of your data and SWAT outputs?

2. *(5 min with a partner)* Share your figure ideas with a partner.

3. *(5 min class discussion)* Share what you and your partner discussed with the class.

## Plotting SWAT Outputs

1. Plot outlet simulation data by month.
```{r}

# select only outlet discharge data
sim_outlet_rch_data = rch_data %>%
  filter(rch == 17) %>%
  mutate(date = paste0(month, "_", year))

# range of simulated outputs by month
ggplot(data = sim_outlet_rch_data, (aes(x = as.factor(month), y = flow_out_cms))) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Monthly Avg Discharage (cms)")

```


2. Plot annual precipitation total over time.
``` {r, message = FALSE}

# import precip data
monthly_precip_data = read_csv('/Users/ssaia/Documents/GitHub/ecohydro-modeling-workshop-mar2018/data/swat_input_data/precip_data/p354-775_reformatted.csv', col_names=TRUE)

# find annual sum
annual_precip_data = monthly_precip_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(annual_precip_mm = sum(monthly_precip_mm))

# bar chart
ggplot(data = annual_precip_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = year, y = annual_precip_mm), stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Annual Precipitaiton (mm)")
  
```


3. Plot SWAT simulated vs observed discharge data at the outlet.
``` {r, message = FALSE, }

# get observed discharge data
obs_outlet_rch_data = read_csv('/Users/ssaia/Documents/GitHub/ecohydro-modeling-workshop-mar2018/data/swat_input_data/streamflow_data/observed_monthly_outlet_flow.csv', col_names=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(date = paste0(month, "_", year)) %>%
  select(-month, -year)

# join simulated and observed data into one table
sim_obs_outlet_rch_data = left_join(sim_outlet_rch_data, obs_outlet_rch_data, by = "date")

# fit a line to the simulated vs observed data and save linear model parameters
my_lm = lm(flow_out_cms ~ obs_flow_out_cms, data = sim_obs_outlet_rch_data)
#summary(my_lm) # to see this uncomment it by removing the # before summary()
my_slope = summary(my_lm)$coef[2]
my_intercept = summary(my_lm)$coef[1]

# plot simulated vs observed monthly discharage with 1:1 line (black) and linear model (red)
ggplot(data = sim_obs_outlet_rch_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = obs_flow_out_cms, y = flow_out_cms)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "black") +
  geom_abline(slope = my_slope, intercept = my_intercept, color = "red") +
  xlim(0, 250) +
  ylim(0, 250) +
  xlab("Observed Monthly Avg Discharage (cms)") +
  ylab("Simulated Monthly Avg Discharge (cms)")

```
